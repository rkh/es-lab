This ES-Harmony Test Suite is an adaptation of the ES5 Conformance Test Suite that can run in a stand-alone shell (i.e. doesn't require a browser).

Writing tests
-------------
Create *.js files adhering to the ES5 Conformance Test suite format in the TestCases subdirectory. See example.js for a skeleton unit test.
Have a look at the bottom of the file consolerunner.js for a list of utility assertion functions.

Running the tests
-----------------
First, generate a file that loads all test code by invoking:
gentests > tests.js

To run the tests, simply load the generated file with your favorite javascript shell, e.g.:
js tests.js

The shell should support 'load(string)' and 'print(string)' globals.

The gentests script accepts a single '-v' verbose option that will also print passing tests.

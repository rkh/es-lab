// Interaction between proxies and the instanceof operator:
// Two cases to consider:
//  case 1: obj instanceof aFunctionProxy
//    aFunctionProxy can influence the result of this operator if its handler’s get
//    trap returns a meaningful value for the 'prototype' property. Internally, the
//    instanceof operator invokes the built-in method [[HasInstance]] on the function,
//    which queries the function’s prototype property.
//
//  case 2: anObjectProxy instanceof aConstructorFunction
//    The proto object passed to the Proxy.create method is used to determine the
//    prototype of the proxy.

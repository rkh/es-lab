// If a proxy handler would return a property descriptor from
// get{Own}PropertyDescriptor whose configurable attribute is false,
// the proxy implementation throws an exception.
// The rationale is that the implementation cannot verify that the property is
// indeed non-configurable: a proxy could deceive a program by returning a
// non-configurable property descriptor but nothing would constrain it to still
// configure the property afterward. Hence, proxies must always reveal their
// properties as being configurable. Instead of having the proxy implementation
// throw an exception when it sees a non-configurable property descriptor,
// it could also silently modify the descriptor to be configurable before returning it,
// but that would be likely to mask errors.
